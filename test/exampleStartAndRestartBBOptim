using BlackBoxOptim

# Lets start and then restart an optimization of 2D rosenbrock
# as in the README:
rosenbrock2d(x) = abs2(1.0 - x[1]) + 100.0 * abs2(x[2] - x[1]^2)

# If you want to restart optimization you need to get a handle
# to the optimizer, problem and params. Use the function
# setup_bboptimize instead of bboptimize, but with the same
# parameters. We just run it for 10 steps though:
opt = bbsetup(rosenbrock2d; SearchRange = (-5.0, 5.0), NumDimensions = 2,
    MaxSteps = 10, TraceMode = :silent);

# Now we can run it (this will do 10 steps):
res10 = bboptimize(opt)

# And lets run it again (another 10 steps):
res20 = bboptimize(opt)
